This code composed of 3 sorting algorithms namely Bubble, Insertion and Selection.

Algorithm Complexity


Algorithm      Best       Worst      Average
Bubble         O(n)       O(n2)       O(n2)  
Selection      O(n2)      O(n2)       O(n2)        
Insertion      O(n)       O(n2)       O(n2)    

Roughly the complexities are almost the same. 
But they have different ways on sorting an array.
Every algorithm has short code and very easy to follow.
